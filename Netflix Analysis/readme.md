# Netflix Analysis
### Description
Created Analysis for streaming platform Netflix using Microsoft Power BI. The data was downloaded from Kaggle.

The data extraction and cleaning was done using Python. Cleaning included removing duplicate, removing empty data and trimming all the data using Python Pandas scripts(Link provided below). The cleaned data was loaded to a CSV file and pushed into powerBI for creating dashboard.

The dataset consisted almost 8000 data and the data consisted of movie name, countries it released, releasing data, director name, type of the content, rating and so many details that would describe the content.

As part of the analysis we found that, between the years 2008 and 2021, 97% of the contents were Movies and 3% were Tv Shows among all the countries. Between 2020 and 2021 we realised netflix has published 84 Tv Shows and total of 180 Tv Shows on the whole between 2008 and 2021 which helped us to learn that Pandemic period had a surging number of Tv Shows releasing.
When looking at the movies releasing, on the whole between 2008 and 2021, we had around 6700 movies released and during pandemic(2020-2021) we got 2500 movies releasing.

On this note we realize that contents releasing in the OTT Streaming platform has started to increase since COVID-19 began. This could fairly bring down the number audience going to down to theatres if OTT platforms started improving quality of the content.
